-- Test: TEST001 (CompGeneral)
-- Owner: Compiler Team
-- Functionality: Check for newly introduced shift/reduce and reduce/reduce
--                conflicts in the parser
-- Table created: none
-- Expected files: EXPECTEDTOK2.*, 
-- Limitations:
--
-- This file is not used for TESTTOK2 on Windows. The file tok2.ksh is run directly from
-- runregr_compGeneral.ksh for Windows builds.
--
-- Revision history:
--     (10/30/02) - Created  from TEST013 of fullstack.
--                  added showshape for some queries to ensure that 
--                  the group by is being pushed down
--     (05/13/06) - Jim Kass: changed call to display_explain to just
--                  explain and removed the '(s)' from the output which
--                  has been supressed.
--     (03/26/12) - Ported to Linux (Hans Zeller)
--                  Top level Makefile now also packages required files
--                  parser/sqlparser.y and toolbin/bison_linux/bison
--                  into the regression tar file

-- process the parser through bison to get a list of shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts
-- in file sqlparser.output. Remove the directory name from the output.
